1/2 head purple cabbage $0.91
2 green bell peppers $1.00
2 carrots $0.27
1 yellow onion $0.42
2 -3 oz bricks ramen noodles $0.54
1/4 cup soy sauce $0.40
3 Tbsp brown sugar $0.05
2 Tbsp Sriracha or less $0.18
1 Tbsp cornstarch $0.04

handful cilantro (optional) $0.28

        </table>
        
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong> Remove the core and any wilted outer leaves from the cabbage, then cut it into very fine strips. Cut the onion and green bell pepper into thin strips as well. Use a large holed cheese grater to shred the carrots.
In a small bowl prepare the sauce by stirring together the soy sauce, brown sugar, sriracha, and corn starch.
Begin to cook the noodles according to the package directions (boil for 3 minutes, or until tender). Drain the cooked noodles in a colander.
Heat the vegetable oil over medium high heat in a large skillet until it is hot and shimmering. Add the vegetables and sauté for only a few minutes, or until the vegetables just begin to soften. Pour the prepared sauce into the skillet and continue to sauté for one to two minutes more, or until the sauce has thickened and coated all of the vegetables. Turn off the heat.
Add the cooked and drained noodles to the stir fried vegetables and toss to combine. Top with sliced green onions and a handful of fresh cilantro, if desired.

            <th>2 Tbsp olive oil $0.32
2 cloves garlic $0.16
1 yellow onion $0.14
1 tsp smoked paprika $0.10
1/2 tsp oregano $0.05
1/4 tsp cumin $0.03
1 cup long grain white rice $0.33
1/2 lb. frozen chopped spinach $0.80
15 oz. can chickpeas $1.15
1 fresh lemon $0.85
1 3/4 cup vegetable broth $0.22
1 oz. feta, crumbled $0.56
            
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>Mince the garlic and dice the onion. Sauté the onion and garlic with olive oil over medium heat in a deep skillet until the onion are soft and transparent (about 3-5 minutes).
Add the smoked paprika, oregano, cumin, and dry rice to the skillet. Stir and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes to toast the rice and spices. You should hear the rice popping and it should begin to look slightly transparent.
Drain the chickpeas and add them to the skillet along with the frozen spinach (no need to thaw). Zest the lemon and set the zest aside. Squeeze about 2 Tbsp of the lemon's juice into the skillet. Add the vegetable broth and stir the ingredients to combine.
Place a lid on the skillet and turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow it to come to a boil, then immediately turn it down to low or just above low. Let the skillet continue to simmer for 20 minutes, with the lid in place. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it sit undisturbed for an additional 5 minutes.
Remove the lid and fluff the skillet with a fork to redistribute the chickpeas and spinach. Sprinkle the lemon zest and crumbled feta over the skillet just before serving.
RECIPE NOTES: The pilaf is shown with parsley, which is an optional garnish, but not needed for flavor.
